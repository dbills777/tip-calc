- Here is the outline for the challenge: [Netlify Deploy](https://awesome-shaw-046d84.netlify.app/)
## Why I built the project this way
- I wanted to buld a project to specification from designs that were ready made.
- I wanted to use Styled.Components for the first time with this project.
## Points to Improve
- I would like to refactor the state management to use the Context api or possible an external state managment like "easy-peasy".
- I Plan add responsive breakpoints and styling for mobile devices.
